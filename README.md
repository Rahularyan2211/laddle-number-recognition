# Ladder Number recognition

This project's goal is intended to act as a part of the pipeline of noting down the number of the ladder all by itself and hence removing the need of human expertise. This project is in Python and computer-vision and utilize EasyOCR and pytorch packages to run.

The pipeline starts with a camera setup that detect the ladder and takes photos which can be stored on to a folder. These set of images can be send through this model which would return the numbers of the ladder and can be used later for refering the location and constituents of the ladder via their number.

Here are a set of images that were taken on site to help and test if our python file can detect the numbers.
